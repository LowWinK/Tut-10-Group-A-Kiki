# Tut-10-Group-A-Kiki
This is my personal part of the group project. I add 3 changes in it.
1. I add a `mousePressed()` and `redrawPatterns()` function. Once it find a pattern is clicked by mouse, the pattern will disappear.
2.I add 2 buttons. One makes all patterns disappear, another resets all patterns.
3.I thought it was too boring to only have black background after the pattern disappeared, so I imported a picture of dmc meme as the background.
